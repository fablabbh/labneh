home made labneh ( Libraries shared on Arduino library management )  

- Start by making sure that your libraries conform to arduino library style [guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/contributions/arduino-library-style-guide)
- Then this list of [requirements](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-are-the-requirements-for-a-library-to-be-added-to-library-manager) have to be met. 
- Example of things to consider [library specifications](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.29/library-specification/) and [library metadata](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.29/library-specification/#library-metadata)
- Or use this command line [tool](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-lint/1.2/) to check for problems in your library project.
- Finally [Here](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/blob/main/README.md#adding-a-library-to-library-manager) are instructions on how to add your library to the arduino library manager.
